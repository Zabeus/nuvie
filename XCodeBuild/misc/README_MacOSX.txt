Running Nuvie on Mac OS X
-------------------------

Step 1.

Copy your Ultima 6 game files into the following directory
'/Library/Application Support/Nuvie Support/ultima6/'

(Note! this is the system wide Library directory.)

Step 2.

Launch the Nuvie application. :)

* Nuvie's config file is located at '$HOME/Library/Preferences/Nuvie Preferences'
  (It will be created when Nuvie is first run.)

* Save games are stored in the following directory
'$HOME/Library/Application Support/Nuvie/savegames/'

***Note***

If Nuvie fails to start for any reason please check the program logs which
should be available from the Console application located in 
'/Applications/Utilities/Console.app'
