Notes on getting Nuvie to build in Visual C7.1 (.NET 2003)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are specific to .NET 2003 (VC 7.1), but the interface did
not change all that much since .NET 2001.  If you can make a .NET 2001 project
you'll probably not need these instructions, anyway. :)


Libraries
---------

First, you must have the Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL) libraries installed.
To get them, go here:  http://www.libsdl.org/index.php

Also, you will now need the SDL Mixer library, which is located here:
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

You can install these anywhere you like.  I have them in a /Libraries folder.


Build Directories
-----------------

Next, open up Visual Studio .NET.  Go to the Tools menu and choose Options.
In the Options dialog, open the Projects folder in the left pane (you may
have to scroll down to see it).  Inside of the Projects folder, choose
"VC++ Directories".  Here, you will need to set up include and library paths
for SDL and SDL_Mixer.  This should be self-explanatory, so I won't give you
the details.  One thing to note, however, is that there is no support for a 
debug build path versus a release build path -- these directories are global.
Since there are both debug and release builds of the SDL libraries, you can
point it to either one.  I recommend you choose the release directory unless
you happen to need to step through SDL code in a debug build.  (NOTE: I know
one way to get around this, but you have to add the .lib files directly to
the project, and that would require your build of SDL to be in a particular
directory in relation to the Nuvie source).


Executing from VS .NET
----------------------

To run nuvie from VS .NET, you must copy the SDL and SDL mixer DLLs into
your build directory.  This will be nuvie/visual7/debug for the debug build
and nuvie/visualc7/release for the release build.  Make sure you copy the same
DLLs over that you're linking to (i.e., relese or debug). 

Also, make a nuvie.cfg (using the sample config from CVS) and place this in
your debug and release directories (this tells Nuvie where to find Ultima 6,
so it is very important).

In the project settings, choose Debugging in the left pane.  It should already
say "$(TargetPath)" in the right hand pane in the Command field.  In the
Working Directory field, add "$(TargetDir)" (without the quotes, of course).

That should be it.  You should now be able to build Nuvie and run it from 
VS .NET.
