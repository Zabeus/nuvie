http://nuvie.sourceforge.net/

What is Nuvie
-------------

Nuvie is an open source engine for Origin's games Ultima 6, Martian Dreams
and The Savage Empire. It uses the original data files from the games. Nuvie
currently runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Nuvie is in the early stages of development. We are currently focusing on
Ultima 6 we hope to fully support Martian Dreams and Savage Empire at a
later date.

Compiling Nuvie
---------------

Unix (various)

Compiling should (hopefully) be as simple as

./configure
make

Win32

Nuvie can be compiled for win32 using either MinGW or MSVC


Using Nuvie
-----------

Nuvie requires some configuration. You will at least need to set the path
to your ultima6 directory in nuvie.cfg
