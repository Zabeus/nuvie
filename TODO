---------------

Command line:
nuvie [options] game(from config)
-h, --help
-s, --savedir, savegame directory ?
?? config location
?? Set gametype or location

Converse/Talk:
0xbf - alternate inventory/portrait view
Consider input buffer filled with spaces as empty
MD SE talking

Event:
Move "now" time to Game or GameClock, add some type to handle ticks
Move TimeQueue/Timer functions to new class file(s)
Take low-level input handling out of Event and make a keybinder.

Actors: There must be a uniform way to set all actors direction and frame, and
to animate them, no matter what size they are.

Iolo "gather" gets gold in containers eg in bags, backpacks (need to do more
testing)

Execute Usecode for post-move actions (frame changes)?
Ex: call an event on "chair" when actor steps on it, to change to sit frame
(This can be used to implement poison/sleep fields.)

Mirror usecode (enter-area, leave-area, and drop)

Improve Party following, make NPCs travel wide angles along roads instead of
shortest path to destination

Use/drop/move objects from inventory

Give message scroller and other GUI areas some high-level I/O methods
