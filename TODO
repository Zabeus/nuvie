Nuvie TO-DO List
----------------

**Note**
We have a separate set of progress documents with a feature checklist. They are kept in the docs repository. Accessible via cvs.
This file may be used for BUGS that need to be fixed, wishlist items, and
random notes, but updates to current features should go in the progress reports.


Cursors: (how the mouse cursor works in U6, need to duplicate)
In normal/move mode (no pending action), cursor is standard arrow over ever
area but the MapWindow. Above the MapWindow it is a directional arrow, or the
small crosshair when over the player. MouseDown over the player passes.
In Look/Talk/Get/Drop/etc modes, the cursor is the small crosshair everywhere.
While talking or displaying a portrait, the cursor is the small crosshair
everywhere. Clicking anywhere in the MapWindow, or one of the buttons, or
any object slot in the Inventory scrolls down the page in MsgScroll.

Event:
Take low-level input handling out of Event and make a keybinder.
Take higher-level functions and move to PlayerAction class. This will be able
to queue actions, and will handle the "mode" that Event has now. It may be where
global actions (quit/save/load?) are too.

DragnDrop:
Don't drag skiffs to land (check object's passable?)

MsgScroll:
Give message scroller and other GUI areas some high-level I/O methods
Change UpArrow/DownArrow to PgUp/Dn

Iolo "gather" should not gather gold from the Avatar's bags
     "split" does take all gold from the Avatar's bags, but adds outside of bags

How does U6 determine which objects are stackable?

Actors:
Do we need a Monster pathfinder? (CombatPathFinder) Find out after creating the
new Combat class.
Add ActorAction to do things like walking to a destination, and worktypes?

Effect: The way pause/resume while doing effects is interesting. If one effect
chains another, it may step out of wait mode before the original effect is
complete. By default this displays the prompt for some effects, so you get
multiple prompts. It also allows stray input if the player is quick. Fix this.
    There are are a couple of issues to fix here. First, the prompt shouldn't
    be displayed manually every time some text is printed. It should only be
    printed from one location when it's the Player's turn. Now that we have
    actual actor turn-management in ActorManager, this should be pretty easy.
    Second, Effects probably don't need to be pausing/unpausing Game directly.
    They could request EffectManager pause for them, until they are deleted.
    This would break Effects that do multiple states with different pause-flags,
    but they should probably be changed to multiple Effects anyway.
    (instead of U6PotionEffect, have MagicCastEffect (combining MapXorEffect
    and SoundEffect) and SeeThroughWallsEffect which takes a time, the entire
    sequence could be wrapped in a PauseUserEffect or EffectManager:wait_for_effect)

wishlist:
real-time mode (but not during combat)
smooth map/actor movement (see SNES U6)
full-screen map w/multiple scales (for balloon flying)
command console
enhanced & classic modes: enable/disable several options at once
high-resolution graphics (someone is already working on a hires graphics pack
for U6O, and said they'd be willing to let Nuvie include it)
