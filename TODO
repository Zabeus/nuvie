Nuvie TODO List
---------------
Command line:
nuvie [options] game(from config)
-h, --help
-s, --savedir, savegame directory ?
?? config location
?? Set gametype or location

Converse/Talk:
0xbf - alternate inventory/portrait view
Consider input buffer filled with spaces as empty
MD SE talking

Event:
Move "now" time to Game or GameClock, add some type to handle ticks
Take low-level input handling out of Event and make a keybinder.
PlayerAction class(es) (ActorActions?)
Use/drop/move objects from inventory
Use and other actions aren't supposed to work when Player is uncontrolled
Action sync.: After an input event is processed, don't allow any more. (right
now you can press keys after doing certain things and quickly get another action
in)
Dragndrop: When releasing object after move, commands should go through some
action queue or through Event, so that the proper checks are performed and the
number of turns are passed that it would take to get to the original location.
Should be able to drop objects on other non-passable objects (move rope to table)
Don't drag skiffs to land (check object's passable?)
When dragging object, show cursor as indicator if object can be dropped in a
location.

Actors:
Improve Party following
Implement speed in LPath (actors walking to work location get up to 4 moves)
And with LPath, NPCs travel wide angles along roads instead of shortest path
to destination (it is not solely based on terrain score).
New Follow pathfinder, follow an actor (if on same plane), with give-up distance
    (also run from actor)
Maybe a new Monster pathfinder

UseCode:
Execute Usecode for post-move actions (frame changes)
Ex: call an event on "chair" when actor steps on it, to change to sit frame
 (This can be used to implement poison/sleep fields.)
move u6ucobject stuff up to UseCode, needs to be generic to avoid duplication

MsgScroll: Give message scroller and other GUI areas some high-level I/O methods
Screenfulls of text should pause even if
not indicated in data, but a break indicated in the data + a screenfull of text
should not cause two breaks (requiring player to ESC twice).
PgUp/Dn

Iolo "gather" gets gold in containers eg in bags, backpacks (need to do more
testing)

Fix actor draw order issues.

Move static mode out of U6Actor::wt_beg because it affects all actors with that
worktype. Change worktype to wander after talked to player.

Replace some actor info with pointer to an Obj?
Actor::[check]move error/status struct? (so that calling function can check)
Actor::[check]move: take move_flags argument (replace current bools force_move/ignore_others)

Move Configuration search to Configuration or somewhere so it can be used in
tools.

things to do:
raft
balloon
combat
weapons
music
sfx

full-screen map w/multiple scales
